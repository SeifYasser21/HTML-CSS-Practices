      <br />
      <p>
        This website is dedicated to asnwer question 5 provided by Joget's
        take-home technical test, I designed the content as stated in the
        questions sent my email. I will use this section to explain the
        interactivity of the website.
      </p>
      <h2>Provided Question</h2>
      <p>
        Using HTML and CSS, create a simple webpage layout with a header,
        footer, and main content section. <br /><br />
        The header should have a background color of blue and contain a centered
        Joget logo and a navigation menu with links to Home, About, and Contact
        pages. <br />
        <br />The main content section should have a white background and
        contain a heading and a paragraph of text. <br />
        <br />The footer should have a gray background and contain copyright
        information and a link to a privacy policy page.
      </p>
      <h2>Index Page</h2>
      <p>
        This is the index page. To get back to this page, click the Joget Logo
        centered at the top of the page.
      </p>
      <h2>Home Page</h2>
      <p>
        The home page would provide some more content for the website, currently
        it will only display a message for the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        To access the home page, click "Home" via the navigation bar at the top
      </p>
      <h2>About Page</h2>
      <p>
        This page is dedicated to provide more information about the
        organization. <br />

        However since there's isn't any content to provide at the current time,
        I'll be utilizing it to intorduce myself to you.<br />

        Do give it a read if you're interested to know more about me, although
        may not be the best introduction I can provide. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        To access the about page, click "About" via the navigation bar at the
        top
      </p>
      <h2>Contact Page</h2>
      <p>
        This page is dedicated to providing any contact information for the
        organization. <br />
        But since there's no actual content for the website, I'll just leave
        some of my own contact information to reach out to me. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        To access the contact page, click "Contact" via the navigation bar at
        the top
      </p>
      <h2>Privacy Policy Page</h2>
      <p>
        Here is where the users can check in on the website's privacy policies.
        <br />
        But I'm not certain of the types of policies companies generally use so
        do enjoy this relaxing vibe-worthy song I added ;].
      </p>
      <p>
        To access the provacy policy page, click "Privacy Policy" via the
        Copyright section at the bottom footer
