      <p>
        This page is dedicated to provide more information about the
        organization. <br />

        However since there's isn't any content to provide at the current time,
        I'll be utilizing it to intorduce myself to you. <br />
        <br />Hello! My name is Seifeldeen Yasser Mohamed Abdelkader Amr, or
        just "Seif" for short. <br />
        I'm a soon-to-be 22-year-old Egyptian seeking a software engineering
        role. I graduated from Taylor's University Lakeside Campus, Subang Jaya
        on March 2023.
        <br /><br />I've been living in Malaysia for 19 years and grew up
        studying here. I lived in Sandakan, Sabah for 12 years before moving to
        Petaling Jaya, Selangor in the year 2017. <br />I learned the native
        languages when I studied in primary school and secondary school, which
        is why I speak 4 lagnuages [English, Malay, Chinese, Arabic (Mother
        Tongue)]. <br />

        <br />
        As for my technical skills, I'm a Python programming specialist with
        knoweldge on backend development with the Flask framework and some
        Machine Learning knowledge with scikit-learn. <br />
        I'm currently learning Java and OOP in order to master the syntax and
        programming style and pickup the Java Springboot framework to further
        enhance my backend development skillset. <br />
        Moreover, I have experience with HTML, CSS, javaScript, jQuery for
        frontend development, and MySQL for databases, but I'm also devling into
        MongoDB to imporve my database skillsets as well.
        <br /><br />

        I'm not the best at intorducing myself so I'll leave it at that. If
        you'd like to know more about me or reach out to me. You may refer to
        the contact page where I will leave my contact information. <br />
        <br />
        Thank you for reading!! Hope to hear from you soon! :]
